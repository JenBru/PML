This repository contains the Practical Machine Learning Course Project R markdown file and accompanying HTML output file.

If the HTML does not properly render and show output, please follow the instructions below.  

## Instructions to view rendered HTML:

1. Copy link for the file in my GitHub repository.
https://github.com/JenBru/PML/blob/master/PML_project.html

2. Navigate to this page in your browser:
http://htmlpreview.github.com/

3. Paste the URL for my repository (copied in step 1 above) into the box that follows the text "Enter URL of the HTML file to preview:"

This should work.  It worked on my computer.  This seems to be a common issue as discussed in the course message board and on stack overflow.  See links here:
